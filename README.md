# Handwritten Digits Recognition Model

The purpose of this model is to show a first approach to the handwriting recognition challenge planned for the internship - Vision System programmer position at Covance. This model is trained using 60,000 images of handwritted digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset and it shows a 98% accuracy when tested with 10,000 images. The model is found in `HandwrittenDigitsRecognition.ipynb`.

The model uses a deep learning approach (neural network with two hidden layers) using different available libraries in Python (Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, and Keras). A brief explanation of the code along with some technicalities are presented below. At the end of this notebooks, a discussion about future steps towards building a handwritting recognition model is presented.

An optimization of the parameters used in the neural network are presented in `Optimization.ipynb`.
